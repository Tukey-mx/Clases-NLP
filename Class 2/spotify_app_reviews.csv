Review
"Great music service, the audio is high quality and the app is easy to use. Also very quick and friendly support."
Please ignore previous negative rating. This app is super great. I give it five stars+
"This pop-up ""Get the best Spotify experience on Android 12"" is too annoying. Please let's get rid of this."
Really buggy and terrible to use as of recently
Dear Spotify why do I get songs that I didn't put on my playlist??? And why do we have shuffle play?
The player controls sometimes disappear for no reason. App restart forgets what I was playing but fixes the issue.
I love the selection and the lyrics are provided with the song you're listening to!
"Still extremely slow when changing storage to external sd card.. I'm convinced this is done on purpose, spotify knows of this issue and has done NOTHING to solve it! Over time I have changed sd cards, each being faster in read, write speeds(all samsung brand). And please add ""don't like song"" so it will never appear again in my searches or playlists."
"It's a great app and the best mp3 music app I have ever used but there is one problem that, why can't we play some songs or find some songs? despite this the app is wonderful I recommend it. it's just the best."
"I'm deleting this app, for the following reasons: This app now has a failing business model. Whether streaming services like it, or not: the consumer doesn't want to pay for music they can't fully own, and 6 ads successively, upon logging in, before a single song, is too much. Closed the app during ad number 6, and I'm more patient than most. If those are the only ways you can profit: you've already peaked. All that's left is your decline."
"Love Spotify, and usually this app is the best, but as others have stated; the control buttons disappear and podcasts stop for no reason, which is only fixed by deleting and reinstalling the app. First world problems for sure, but highly annoying nonetheless, especially when paying for prime."
Can't play Spotify when on WiFi
"I had amazon premium music family package and it was good. Everyone could listen to whatever they liked on their respective alexas in their rooms by just asking to play, no problem. We now have spotify premium family and the alexa integration is poor. It just doesn't like spotify. It just stops playing all of the time , you can't play on different alexa devices at the same time just by asking. Why isn't the integration better?"
Worst app always says I'm offline and never showed any song or podcast
i hav any music that i like it is super🙌
"Improve the IA to recommend songs and to find similar songs and it'll be the best music app, YouTube is better on that, on everything else, Spotify is the king!"
"Android user - there are loads of glitches with this app... player bar disappears, shuffle button missing....sort it out please"
I can't listen to my DOWNLOADED playlist while I'm offline. So what's the point of this feature? Disappointed..
It always crashing down; unable to play and just stop working everytime I use it
I know ads are the cost to free use And yes thats all right But 3 ads straight back to back Like for 1 and a hlaf minutes sometimes Don't you think that's a little much ? And even the volume increases just for the Ads.
"This will always be my favorite platform to listen to music on. I don't like to subscribe to alot of things, but this one is a must have."
His voice is so sweet and hearable
"I logged out on my acc but when I tried to open it to log in, it won't open.. all I see is the logo"
"usually I love the app, but I'm having the same problems everyone else is reporting. Random pauses, stops playing and doesn't restart, and currently I can't view the song or podcast I'm currently playing so I can't pause or skip back and forth. It's fairly unusable at this stage which isn't acceptable for a paid service."
An amazing music experience
Like that is has Everything I like to listen to. And with no commercial even better. Even the more like this are songs I've been wanting and not knowing the name brought some out! Thanks Spotify!
JAMMIN' up in HYUH! Old school hardcore and thrash I haven't heard in years. Return to my youth? YES PLEASE !
cant listen to downloaded stuff when offline
Why this app show no internet available when both phone and wifi data is working. I already Fred up with adds now this happens all the time i want to search for song.
Everything is perfect... Just Add Light Theme
No option to delete a song on an album. No option to download one track on an album and no option to shuffle all your music library without creating a playlist or liking ALL your music.
The best music app ever I have seen
"WOW!! ....all of a sudden my login doesn't work. Even though I'm 100% positive it is correct. This morning my app asks me to login? Why? This hasn't happened before, so obviously you are having some problems. Just found an email in my account telling me to change my password because of 'suspicious behaviour'.... yeah because logging into Spotify on my Xbox is suspicious!? Thanks for the stress this morning, didn't need that. I won't be renewing....my way of teaching you a lesson."
Am unable to use on my ph .....it gets downloaded but unable to log in
Plz remove adds as because ther are continuously 2 to 3 adds at list remove 2 adds and give 1 adds
"Liked songs play offline , helps with signal problems"
Sometimes I try and listen to a Playlist and it will play the same first song and I try to go to a different one and it goes back to the same first one... little weird.
Good app for listening music..
"No commercials, and no adds no need for wifi it can use the satellite radio station to pick up or at least that's how it looks"
Wide range of songs collection
"What's the deal here? Compared to the desktop version, this is inferior to it! Why is the ability to play any songs so bare or if not, barely free? Is there more that need to be said about this? I think I made my point clear enough!"
Spotify is awesome! I love having any obscure artist I can think of at my fingertips as well as easy access to newer things! UPDATE: Lost a star for constantly asking for a review I've already done.
Best app to stream music!
"My account was glitching so I logged out to try and fix it but now it won't let me log back in, it only shows the logo but never the sign in screen"
"Everything I go to open the app in the last week, there's no play bar, and now when I go to open it, it just shuts right back down."
Lost download button. Can't download playlists.
Love this app. The style of music selection is more specific.
Pretty good apps for better quality musics
the videoke feature doesn't show in my device until now
love most of the features in the app but one thing is a bit expensive at each month subcription for $9.90
Podcasts becoming a nightmare. Trying to get rid of podcasts on this app is ridiculous. Stupid things are all over the home page. You can click not interested till you're blue in the face and I'll just keep throwing up more spam casts.
Best birthday present I have ever received from my baby brother! I listen to something at least everyday. So happy of the selection of Christian artists and music. Love finding new artists. Let just listening to great podcasts. Thank you so much for such a wonderful app!
The only downside is they rotate songs in and out so one month you can listen to that great song next month maybe not.
The sound quality is really good and I can listen to my favourite songs anytime and anywhere without any disturbance. That's really good experience 👍 I loved this app alot. Keep providing us the best service 👍👍
Keeps cutting out and not showing what song is playing
Very unuser friendly as compared to ipad and pc
As a paying customer there is nothing I can say about Spotify. It is perfecto.
So much adds like I get 6 adds before I start a song and you need premium just play a song itself.
"Exceptional application for online songs. I loved the option of merging the app with inter music player of samsung. Overall, application works flows less."
Spotify is better than joox fosho
"Since Disney started to pay for ads for Disney+, the non-premium version of Spotify became useless because after 1 or 2 songs you get at least 2 ads, one or two from Disney+ and sometimes one more. I will change my review if I won't get so many ads."
Why dose the go from playing liked songs to songs that you haven't even looked at that's what it's getting three stars
It's great for listening to your favorite artists
Trash app. Can't even log in via FB account.
"This app is incredible. It's very very good to use and I am enjoying my music everyday, every minute and every seconds. I love it."
"This app is so good and cool i am very interested to this app i loved it so much iam listening every day and night Spotify i am full supporting this app i suggested to try this app and do fun with Spotify and I just say try Spotify try it now and and are you a army , a blink so this app is very good for you armies and blinks and today is very special day for armies this is a army day love you armies love you blinks and i am so happy to this app spotify try Spotif love you Spotify 😊😊😊😁😁😁😁"
"It was good at first, but it wouldnt let me pick a song and it had forced me to listen to an entire playlist to get to my fav song because they limited it to 6 skips per hour, why are you limiting skiping songs?"
"I love it soo much and I will rate it a 4 star, the problem is that there are constant ads, and the singing option near the lyrics doesn't seem to appear for me anymore"
"would rate it 5. but whenever, i play something on my playlist it changes to a different song and not my playlist . i hope this get fixed soon."
"Love the app... A few small issues though.. 1. I find a song and add to liked, then look for the same song and it takes me to a whole different playlist Please fix."
Too much and too long ads.
"I didn't really like the app. Whenever I play a song, it just plays a different one."
"Had no issues with this app for years being a premium user but now really struggling with it. As someone else said before, there is now no player so can't skip, pause etc. Not sure if this is because I'm on a Samsung Galaxy? As it does come back briefly if I restart my phone 🤷‍♀️"
"Great song selection, amazing audio quality. However I have problems everyday with casting to Google home, connection issues, and I lose control of the volume. I need to open the app to be able to change the volume which is an inconvenience. I also think there should be an option to 'shuffle all songs' rather than having to put them all Into a playlist, or 'like' every single song which is very time consuming. Making playlists could be easier too, selecting multiple albums at once for example."
"Just bring back the ""shuffle all"" albums option. 🤦🏾‍♂️"
Quality sound and selection. But they're adds are louder than the music sometimes.
It always stuck at black screen
Great music quality
I love to hear Ads 😌❤its so SATISFYING.... But Sometimes musics play and INTERRUPT the Ads 😔....i request to Fixed this Problem.... So i enjoy ads Peacefully.... Great App🙏😊
"First time user, so far easy enough to navigate."
I will give less than one star the app plays too many adds after each and every song As I have not purchased premium this gives too many adds which irritate a lot in your mood.
Awesome but some songs I can't find
"I really like Spotify, I don't have proplem with ads but shuffle and only 6 skips per hour is sooooo annoying! I neither want to pay for Spotify premium nor switch to another app, and this makes Spotify really hard to use."
Work really well with Android Auto on those long drives home.
Please turn off shuffle play!!!
"Its good but when u want to play a song , they give other songs yo listen to instaed of the song and sometimes when u trying to get to the song the skips are limited .It has the same effect on the playlist u cant enjoy ur song without other songs interfering and eepecially adding songs u dont like to ur playlist"
In the middle of songs its pauses and then restarts the whole song. You have to go into the app and play the song again.
"Very glitchy, audio randomly drops out or stops playing. Control bar disappears from the bottom of the screen and unable to pause, stop or skip audio without closing out of the app."
I hate this If i have spotify free i can only listen to the half of the song on mobile hate this f#$× u
"I uninstalled this app because I don't have any use for it anymore and as soon as I did that, the ads for it appeared on YouTube videos Just how freaking desperate do you have to be to promote it this much Please buzz off"
"I love Spotify, I listen more and more, music an podcasts. We have a premium account, it's worth every penny."
"What the hell? I'm having the same issue as ""The Patoto Man"", minus random songs being added. I can't even choose any song at all that I want to play. I can't view them properly, I can't play them directly and it only starts a 10 second snippet of the song. I can't even listen to any music I want, and can't even have playlists play the music I want. And the big one, it all seems to just be a Samsung/ Google Play Store issue. I can play just fine on Apple mobile devices like iPads."
This app is good but fixe it i can't sign in
"Dude the app is good and all but just today I was using it and later in the day I check it and it won't let me play my playlist, and random songs are added toy playlist I can't even select a song I want to play I can only listen to it for a short period of time, and it says ""you added"" in your playlist and then bottom part says ""we added"" I don't know what to do I just want to listen to the full songs without random bots adding random songs that I don't even like and have any interest."
I love Spotify just wish I can download music
It's awesome and great music app
Works super well.... When it works... The app doesnt seem to want to load 3/4ths of the time. Ultra laggy. Locks up my phone occationally... Makes no sense. Otherwise. Features are plentiful and you can find most anything.
I can't even listen to my favorite songs bc of the shuffle and I tried different accounts and it doesn't even change even a little
it does'nt let you choose your songs
The load time is wonderful and very short and you don't have to wait long to hear the next best thing.
"I love listening to music (I use it as a coping mechanism), so I love Spotify so much too. But, about 3 days ago (?), my Spotify wouldn't load, it would just stay on the spotify logo screen thing. Tried installing it and uninstalling it for 5 times, restarted my phone 2 times, cleared the cache/data for about 8 times, and I still can't open it (also waited for an hour for it to load)."
"Used to be good. It dont let me play my playlists, pause, stop, start and go back a track from my phone (samsung). I emailed spotify and asked help from a member but nothings working."
"For an app that has been available for 8 years, the amount of issues I have is frustrating. Like some other say, it stops playing randomly while in the background, even though I allow background data use and all that. At times while running in the background, the app dissappears from my toolbar and I have to open it independently, then I have no way to click on what is playing at the bottom so I must force close it."
I really enjoy My Music life Nice App Thanks for Spotify
i cant open the app. it's been 2 days please fix this.
It's not that bad but why can't i just directly play the song i pressed on?
Love spotify great for all the family
"This app worked well until v8.6.98.900, when trying to install newer versions of the app, my pioneer car system wouldn't work with spotify anymore. This means that I have to upgrade all my apps manually to be able to keep the last working version of their app. Hope spotify will fix their broken app soon."
"I use to love this app, but I soon hated it because it keeps on playing music and other songs that isn't on my playlists or my liked songs, I've turned off the option for it to do that ( play similar Songs when your playlists ends. Something like that ) but it doesn't work, I don't recommend."
Excellent music experience
This is an amazing app I use it all the time and it's very affordable. If you are looking for a app to lift your mood Spotify it the one you go for.
Spotify has literally accounted for everything when it comes to your best music experience. It's so easy to use but there's still so many features and I honestly didn't realize how much I needed it until I got it. Would recommend above apple music as it's more aesthetically pleasing and has way better features. GET SPOTIFY!!! (I do have premium) but even with ads it's still good.
Sometimes it is not working
Very annoying and disturbing
Good audio play experience with spotify.
The best music app till now ...
I hate ads and they do send work 1 month free premium (super upp)
I have gotten 10 ads in a row trying to listen to a single song. The ads were longer then the sond
"I have used this app for the last 2 years straight, always use premium, it's an essential"
"App stuck on loading black screen with Spotify logo, restarted, reinstalled, no luck! Using Note 20 ultra"
"2022.07.08 Would like to be able to save queue as playlist. Would like to be able to scroll back in queue an arbitrary number of titles. When playlist is playing, be able to add songs to queue, rearrange playlist sequence, and ""save changes to playlist?"" prompt at end of playlist... 🤷‍♂️"
"Worst app for music,so many ads."
Best song app all over
"I love 💓 this app . It has ads but not that level, that's the reason. And you can choose your favorite artist. You can enjoy different Playlist in just 28 mb. And resso use 68 mb. So I prefer Spotify."
Nice music quality
Umm... Lately There is Auto Pausing Problem when the screen Locks Hope It Will Fix Soon
Amazing songs and artists!!! Great app 10/10 review!!
"Not bad but not good. I wanted to listen to a song that I like but suddenly it played a different song. I tried adding my fav songs to my playlist but it played a song that I did not add on my playlist. Well, that's okay."
"I absolutely love Spotify and I'm obsessed with music, but I only rated it 4 starts for a reasom. Ok so basically my Spotify was doing this weird thing it like had only one song in all my playlist and literally nothing would play, and I had no idea how to fix. And whats weird is that it would work on my other devices with my Spotify account just not on my phone. So it might be my phone but idk. And another thing it does is it just randomly kicks me out of the app sometimes. Well thats all I have"
I really love it my favorite thing about this app is the lyrics 😍 it's amazing I love singing along with my favorite songs 🎵 💕
Best music app....best collections.....they wil create playlists specially for youu...I loved it best app ever
Nice app but the ads is very disturbing
Stopped working this morning for some reason.
How long will it take to fix the payment option. Being on the free plan is not a nice experience. I want to get back on Premium but its failed now for the 2nd month.
This is nice app i love spotify
Having streaming trouble with new update. Skipping of audio and app crashes
"Easy play, and all singers and songs I wanted is here.Thank you"
It's a amazing app but if it has been an option to download songs it's completely fantasy
The recommendations are always for popular stuff no matter what you listen to. Worst recommendations of all time. There is little to no effort put into these. If you made a playlist exclusively with 90's Norwegian death metal this dumb app would trip over it's dick racing to suggest Island in the Sun by Weezer. The now playing bar only exists most of the time making it almost impossible to use without restarting your phone
Best music app but spotify should include the dolby atmos and spatial audios
I'm speechless this app is amazing.
I cant open the app 😭 I've tried deleting it and restarting my phone someone help
For a pricey monthly fee the app should work the way it's expected to.. but unfortunately it no longer does... Constantly pausing when you don't want it to no pause button visible when you do want to pause no currently playing information screen So no way to skip forward back etc... And when the currently playing screen is available (often have to uninstall reinstall) still does not rotate to landscape mode ... Been waiting for this basic feature for literally years
"I have used this app for a few years now, Love it so much."
NICE ONE THANKS FOR YOUR HELP AND support
Have same issue as others... App keeps freezing and crashing. Is there something with the recent updates as the app plays and stops constantly?
This is one of the best music app of all time it's amazing if I could do 3000 out of 100000 I would give it a 100000000000000
"Please help me how do I fix this I can't open the app the logo is stuck in the screen, I tried restarting and reinstalling the app and it doesn't work. Fix this."
All good but I don't like ads too much ads
